// Package parser implements a parser for Go source files. Input may be
// provided in a variety of forms (see the various Parse* functions); the
// output is an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the Go source. The
// parser is invoked through one of the Parse* functions.
//
// The parser accepts a larger language than is syntactically permitted by
// the Go spec, for simplicity, and for improved robustness in the presence
// of syntax errors. For instance, in method declarations, the receiver is
// treated like an ordinary parameter list and thus may contain multiple
// entries where the spec permits exactly one. Consequently, the corresponding
// field in the AST (ast.FuncDecl.Recv) field is not restricted to one entry.
