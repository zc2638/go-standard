// Package aes implements AES encryption (formerly Rijndael), as defined in
// U.S. Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 197.
//
// The AES operations in this package are not implemented using constant-time algorithms.
// An exception is when running on systems with enabled hardware support for AES
// that makes these operations constant-time. Examples include amd64 systems using AES-NI
// extensions and s390x systems using Message-Security-Assist extensions.
// On such systems, when the result of NewCipher is passed to cipher.NewGCM,
// the GHASH operation used by GCM is also constant-time.
