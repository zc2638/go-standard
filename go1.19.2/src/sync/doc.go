// Package sync provides basic synchronization primitives such as mutual
// exclusion locks. Other than the Once and WaitGroup types, most are intended
// for use by low-level library routines. Higher-level synchronization is
// better done via channels and communication.

// Values containing the types defined in this package should not be copied.
