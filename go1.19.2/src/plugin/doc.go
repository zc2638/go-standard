// Package plugin implements loading and symbol resolution of Go plugins.
//
// A plugin is a Go main package with exported functions and variables that
// has been built with:
//
//	go build -buildmode=plugin
//
// When a plugin is first opened, the init functions of all packages not
// already part of the program are called. The main function is not run.
// A plugin is only initialized once, and cannot be closed.
//
// Currently plugins are only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.
// Please report any issues.
