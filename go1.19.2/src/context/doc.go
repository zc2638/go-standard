// Package context defines the Context type, which carries deadlines,
// cancellation signals, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries
// and between processes.
//
// Incoming requests to a server should create a Context, and outgoing
// calls to servers should accept a Context. The chain of function
// calls between them must propagate the Context, optionally replacing
// it with a derived Context created using WithCancel, WithDeadline,
// WithTimeout, or WithValue. When a Context is canceled, all
// Contexts derived from it are also canceled.
//
// The WithCancel, WithDeadline, and WithTimeout functions take a
// Context (the parent) and return a derived Context (the child) and a
// CancelFunc. Calling the CancelFunc cancels the child and its
// children, removes the parent's reference to the child, and stops
// any associated timers. Failing to call the CancelFunc leaks the
// child and its children until the parent is canceled or the timer
// fires. The go vet tool checks that CancelFuncs are used on all
// control-flow paths.
//
// Programs that use Contexts should follow these rules to keep interfaces
// consistent across packages and enable static analysis tools to check context
// propagation:
//
// Do not store Contexts inside a struct type; instead, pass a Context
// explicitly to each function that needs it. The Context should be the first
// parameter, typically named ctx:
//
//	func DoSomething(ctx context.Context, arg Arg) error {
//		// ... use ctx ...
//	}
//
// Do not pass a nil Context, even if a function permits it. Pass context.TODO
// if you are unsure about which Context to use.
//
// Use context Values only for request-scoped data that transits processes and
// APIs, not for passing optional parameters to functions.
//
// The same Context may be passed to functions running in different goroutines;
// Contexts are safe for simultaneous use by multiple goroutines.
//
// See https://blog.golang.org/context for example code for a server that uses
// Contexts.
