// Package regexp implements regular expression search.
//
// The syntax of the regular expressions accepted is the same
// general syntax used by Perl, Python, and other languages.
// More precisely, it is the syntax accepted by RE2 and described at
// https://golang.org/s/re2syntax, except for \C.
// For an overview of the syntax, run
//
//	go doc regexp/syntax
//
// The regexp implementation provided by this package is
// guaranteed to run in time linear in the size of the input.
// (This is a property not guaranteed by most open source
// implementations of regular expressions.) For more information
// about this property, see
//
//	https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html
//
// or any book about automata theory.
//
// All characters are UTF-8-encoded code points.
// Following utf8.DecodeRune, each byte of an invalid UTF-8 sequence
// is treated as if it encoded utf8.RuneError (U+FFFD).
//
// There are 16 methods of Regexp that match a regular expression and identify
// the matched text. Their names are matched by this regular expression:
//
//	Find(All)?(String)?(Submatch)?(Index)?
//
// If 'All' is present, the routine matches successive non-overlapping
// matches of the entire expression. Empty matches abutting a preceding
// match are ignored. The return value is a slice containing the successive
// return values of the corresponding non-'All' routine. These routines take
// an extra integer argument, n. If n >= 0, the function returns at most n
// matches/submatches; otherwise, it returns all of them.
//
// If 'String' is present, the argument is a string; otherwise it is a slice
// of bytes; return values are adjusted as appropriate.
//
// If 'Submatch' is present, the return value is a slice identifying the
// successive submatches of the expression. Submatches are matches of
// parenthesized subexpressions (also known as capturing groups) within the
// regular expression, numbered from left to right in order of opening
// parenthesis. Submatch 0 is the match of the entire expression, submatch 1 is
// the match of the first parenthesized subexpression, and so on.
//
// If 'Index' is present, matches and submatches are identified by byte index
// pairs within the input string: result[2*n:2*n+2] identifies the indexes of
// the nth submatch. The pair for n==0 identifies the match of the entire
// expression. If 'Index' is not present, the match is identified by the text
// of the match/submatch. If an index is negative or text is nil, it means that
// subexpression did not match any string in the input. For 'String' versions
// an empty string means either no match or an empty match.
//
// There is also a subset of the methods that can be applied to text read
// from a RuneReader:
//
//	MatchReader, FindReaderIndex, FindReaderSubmatchIndex
//
// This set may grow. Note that regular expression matches may need to
// examine text beyond the text returned by a match, so the methods that
// match text from a RuneReader may read arbitrarily far into the input
// before returning.
//
// (There are a few other methods that do not match this pattern.)
