// Package syscall contains an interface to the low-level operating system
// primitives. The details vary depending on the underlying system, and
// by default, godoc will display the syscall documentation for the current
// system. If you want godoc to display syscall documentation for another
// system, set $GOOS and $GOARCH to the desired system. For example, if
// you want to view documentation for freebsd/arm on linux/amd64, set $GOOS
// to freebsd and $GOARCH to arm.
// The primary use of syscall is inside other packages that provide a more
// portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".  Use
// those packages rather than this one if you can.
// For details of the functions and data types in this package consult
// the manuals for the appropriate operating system.
// These calls return err == nil to indicate success; otherwise
// err is an operating system error describing the failure.
// On most systems, that error has type syscall.Errno.
//
// Deprecated: this package is locked down. Callers should use the
// corresponding package in the golang.org/x/sys repository instead.
// That is also where updates required by new systems or versions
// should be applied. See https://golang.org/s/go1.4-syscall for more
// information.
