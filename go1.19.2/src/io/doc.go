// Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.
// Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives,
// such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that
// abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.
//
// Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with
// various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not
// assume they are safe for parallel execution.
