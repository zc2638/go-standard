// Package heap provides heap operations for any type that implements
// heap.Interface. A heap is a tree with the property that each node is the
// minimum-valued node in its subtree.
//
// The minimum element in the tree is the root, at index 0.
//
// A heap is a common way to implement a priority queue. To build a priority
// queue, implement the Heap interface with the (negative) priority as the
// ordering for the Less method, so Push adds items while Pop removes the
// highest-priority item from the queue. The Examples include such an
// implementation; the file example_pq_test.go has the complete source.
