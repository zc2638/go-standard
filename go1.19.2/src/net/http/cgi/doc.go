// Package cgi implements CGI (Common Gateway Interface) as specified
// in RFC 3875.
//
// Note that using CGI means starting a new process to handle each
// request, which is typically less efficient than using a
// long-running server. This package is intended primarily for
// compatibility with existing systems.
