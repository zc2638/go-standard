// Package filepath implements utility routines for manipulating filename paths
// in a way compatible with the target operating system-defined file paths.
//
// The filepath package uses either forward slashes or backslashes,
// depending on the operating system. To process paths such as URLs
// that always use forward slashes regardless of the operating
// system, see the path package.
