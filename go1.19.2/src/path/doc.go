// Package path implements utility routines for manipulating slash-separated
// paths.
//
// The path package should only be used for paths separated by forward
// slashes, such as the paths in URLs. This package does not deal with
// Windows paths with drive letters or backslashes; to manipulate
// operating system paths, use the path/filepath package.
